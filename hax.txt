$Description "Game-breaking silliness.

What happens to the bullet hose when they don't need to reload? Or never ending volcano of doom?

Think of this a first person shoot 'em up.

This mod ain't balanced, hard, or remotely sensible. It's dumb and you probably shouldn't play it: It's a cheat mode wrapped up in a mod. Good thing no one can get actual exp from this.

Still, the source code may be useful for someone trying to see how to modify perks.

Changes from vanilla survival:

* Infinite Ammo, no reload required
* Zeds are all at 6P health levels
* 4 times normal number of Zeds per wave
* Max Monsters Alive = 20 + 32 * #players maxmonsters
* Spawn rate is 0
* Spawner is called 10 times a second
* No trader lines spoken

Making this puppy run:

* Start Killing Floor 2
* Hit tilde ~ to bring down the console
* Enter in the following: open kf-burningparis?game=Hax.Hax_Survival
* Swap kf-burningparis for other maps (eg. kf-outpost)
* Change difficulty by supplying another difficulty parameter. So for HoE it could be: open kf-burningparis?game=Hax.Hax_Survival?Difficulty=3 (Note: 0=Normal)
