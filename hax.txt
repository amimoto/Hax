$Description "Game-breaking silliness.

What happens to the bullet hose when they don't need to reload? Or never ending volcano of doom?

This mod ain't balanced, hard, or remotely sensible. It's dumb and you probably shouldn't play it: It's a cheat mode wrapped up in a mod. Good thing no one can get actual exp from this.

Still, the source code may be useful for someone trying to see how to modify perks.

Changes from vanilla survival:

* Infinite Ammo, no reload required
* Use CD to increase the number of Zeds on screen
* No trader lines spoken

Making this puppy run:

* Start Killing Floor 2
* Hit tilde ~ to bring down the console
* Enter in the following: open kf-burningparis?game=Hax.Hax_Survival
* Swap kf-burningparis for other maps (eg. kf-outpost)
* Change difficulty by supplying another difficulty parameter. So for HoE it could be: open kf-burningparis?game=Hax.Hax_Survival?Difficulty=3 (Note: 0=Normal)
