$Description "Game-breaking silliness.

What happens to the bullet hose when they don't need to reload? Or never ending volcano of doom?

Annnddddd... mix that up with ControlledDifficulty?

Think of this a first person shoot 'em up.

Hax is a mod built on top of the mod ControlledDifficulty.

This mod ain't balanced or remotely sensible. It's dumb and you probably shouldn't play it: It's a cheat mode wrapped up in a mod. Good thing no one can get actual exp from this.

It's hilarious with the right group though.

And just maybe the source code may be useful for someone trying to see how to modify perks.

This may be the last update to this particular mod. Most of the functionality and more will become available in YeeHaw.

Changes from vanilla survival:

* Infinite Ammo, no reload required (Grenades, syringe are still behaves like in vanilla)
* No trader lines spoken
* Requires ControlledDifficulty to also be installed

Changes from previous version

* Zeds are all at 6P health levels
* Max Monsters Alive = 20 + 32 * #players maxmonsters
* Spawn rate is 0
* Spawner is called 10 times a second
* 4 times normal number of Zeds per wave

Making this puppy run:

* Start Killing Floor 2
* Hit tilde ~ to bring down the console
* Enter in the following: open kf-burningparis?game=Hax.Hax_Survival
* Swap kf-burningparis for other maps (eg. kf-outpost)
* Change difficulty by supplying another difficulty parameter. So for HoE it could be: open kf-burningparis?game=Hax.Hax_Survival?Difficulty=3 (Note: 0=Normal)
